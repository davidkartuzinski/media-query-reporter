WordPress Media Query Reporter Plugin for Developers
====================================================

A little plugin to help with height and width of viewports when custom theme developers need more than Responsive Mode in the browsers..


## Why this Plugin?

Writing CSS and as little CSS as possible usually involves only coding to breakpoints when there are changes in the display of the page. These changes don't occur at precise widths or heights, but can happen at a width or height.  This plugin reports the exact dimensions, so that you can code as little as possible.

## How do I use it?

You install and activate the plugin like any other plugin.  Only use in your development environment. Deactivate and uninstall when done with theme development and insure not activated or even installed on live production sites.
